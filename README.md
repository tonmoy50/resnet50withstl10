# Resnet50 with STL10
This is an implementation of Resnet50 model with STL10 Dataset on Google Colab. Here I have used *Progressive Resizing* and *Discriminative Learning Rate* to evaluate the model. 

## Accuracy
I have gotten the following accuracy,
| Model(Shape)   | Accuracy |
| -------------  | -------- |
| Model1(96x96)  |  66.5%   |
| Model1(128x128)|  82.8%   |
| Model1(256x256)|  89.1%   |
